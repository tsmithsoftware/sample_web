# "Pod Work" Project

## Overview
I need to record a video of the "work I've done for the pod".

This project will [create a basic React calendar](https://medium.com/@moodydev/create-a-custom-calendar-in-react-3df1bfd0b728) and [use webpack to bundle it into a C# .NET application](https://dev.to/milenamonteiro/how-to-easily-load-react-apps-into-an-aspnet-project-using-webpack-728).

I'm just going to code a quick calendar talking to an API with a UI test set up and put it forward as a "POC".

### Techology
* React
* Webpack
